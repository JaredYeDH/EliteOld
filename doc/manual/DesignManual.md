## Core Features

RedApple is a fast, usable, C Style Compiler Infrastructure, which not only works independently as a little compiler, but also can be an embedding compiler library.

RedApple supports the following features:

1. Global Functions without Prior Declaration
2. Common Type System
3. Simplified Pointer
4. Constant Fields
5. Control Flow Statements
6. Metadata and Reflection
7. User Macros

Maybe a demo source code will show these features intuitively:

```c
int main() {
    // here we used the metadata to call
    // the 'print' function with its name
    FunctionCall("print", 5);
    return 0;
}


// user macro can make your grammar,
// and here we receved three parameters
defmacro for_n (p, size, code)  {
    for (int p = 1; p <= size; p = p+1)
        code;
}

void print(int k) {
    // call the user macro, i and k are two parameters,
    // the block '{}' is a parameter in its entirety.
    @for_n (i, k) {
        printf("hello-%d\n", i);
    }
}

```

Now we are going to discuss the design and how to make it.

## Introduction

Most compilers adhere to the basic structural models which is known as Compiler Architecture. These models can be divided into five consecutive processes, known as Lexical Analysis, Syntactic Analysis, Semantic Analysis, and Target Code Generation.

![Basic Compiler Architecture](ca.jpg)

We used LLVM Infrastructure[^1] to optimize our intermediate bitcode, and LLC[^2] to generate the object code. The optimiztion and target code generation are included in LLC.
So our working flow will be like the following Figure \ref{f1}:


![\label{f1}RedApple Compiler Workflow](cp.png)


The special point is that the Semantic Analysis was replaced by Macro Translation, which is used to extend the grammer more conveniently.

When the object files are all created, compiler will call the linker of system to build the executable program. This linker stage has been shown in Figure \ref{linker}.

### Major Modules

RedApple Compiler have five major modules:

* Lexical analyzer and Parser (generated by Flex and Bison)  
    Which is used to analysis the structrue of input files.
* Node Models  
    The composition of AST(Abstract Syntax Tree)
* Pass Manager  
    Manage to run multi-pass translation
* Marco Translator  
    Same as Semantic Analysis
* Low-Level Code Generator  
    Unified abstraction layer for LLVM and other Code Generator

The call graph shows their relationships between each other:

## Lexical Analysis and Parsing

To make a simple lexical analyzer, we used Flex[^3], same as Lex, an unix utility for generating lexical analyzer that perform pattern-matching on text. It reads the Lex configuration file and generate C/C++ code which can be compile to a lexical analyzer library and has approximately the same high performance as hand-written analyzer.

A basic Lex configuration file has three parts which are splited by `%%`:

```c
/* C headers and definitions */

%%

 /* pattern-matching rules of tokens */

%%

/* user's C/C++ code */

```

Another core utility is Bison[^4], a parser generator employing LALR(1) parser tables and fully backward compatible with Yacc. It has the configuration file same as Lex and has been designed working together with it. Next, we are going to explain the first two steps and how they are designed.

Here is a basic calculator made by Bison, which parses and calculates the line of expression:

```c
/* parser.y */
/* Location tracking calculator.  */

%{
  #include <cmath>
  int yylex (void);
  void yyerror (char const *);
%}

/* Bison declarations.  */
%define api.value.type {int}
%token NUM

%left '-' '+'
%left '*' '/'
%precedence NEG
%right '^'

%% /* The grammar follows.  */

input:
  %empty
| input line
;

line:
  '\n'
| exp '\n' { printf ("%d\n", $1); }
;

exp:
  NUM           { $$ = $1; }
| exp '+' exp   { $$ = $1 + $3; }
| exp '-' exp   { $$ = $1 - $3; }
| exp '*' exp   { $$ = $1 * $3; }
| exp '/' exp
    {
      if ($3)
        $$ = $1 / $3;
      else
        {
          $$ = 1;
          fprintf (stderr, "%d.%d-%d.%d: division by zero",
                   @3.first_line, @3.first_column,
                   @3.last_line, @3.last_column);
        }
    }
| '-' exp %prec NEG     { $$ = -$2; }
| exp '^' exp           { $$ = pow ($1, $3); }
| '(' exp ')'           { $$ = $2; }

%%

int
main (void)
{
  return yyparse ();
}

```

[^3]: Flex - The Fast Lexical Analyzer (from <http://flex.sourceforge.net/>)
[^4]: Bison - GNU Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR(1) parser tables.(from <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>)


We find that all the tokens are undefined, as a matter of fact, which will be defined in the configuration file of Lex.

```lex
/* scanner.l */

%{

#include "parser.hpp"
#include <cstdlib>

#define SAVE_TOKEN     yylval = maketoken(yytext, yyleng)
extern "C" int yywrap() { return 1; }
int maketoken(const char* data, int len);
%}

%%

[0-9]+                  SAVE_TOKEN; return NUM;

"("                     return '(';
")"                     return ')';
"+"                     return '+';
"-"                     return '-';
"*"                     return '*';
"/"                     return '/';
"^"                     return '^';

%%

int maketoken(const char* data, int len) {
    char* str = new char[len+1];
    strncpy(str, data, len);
    str[len] = 0;
    int num = atoi(str);
    delete str;
    return num;
}

```

Each token defined by the 'parser.y' file will be a number which the pattern-matching returns in the 'scanner.l'  (A char also can be known as a number).


### The Difficulties in Lexical Analysis

One of the difficulties is analysing the comment such as `/* */`. We need to enumerate all the possiblities in the Regex. The classic solution looks like:

```lex

%%
"/*"([^\*]|(\*)*[^\*/])*(\*)*"*/" ; /* the comment likes this kind */
 /* => */
"/*"   (  [^\*]   |   (\*)* [^\*/]   )*   (\*)*    "*/" ;
```

Returning anything means that lexical analyzer will discard comment statements.

Some other important regexs have been listed below:

```lex
%{
#define SAVE_TOKEN     yylval.str = maketoken(yytext, yyleng)
#define SAVE_STRING    yylval.str = maketoken(yytext, yyleng)
#define SAVE_STRING_NC yylval.str = maketoken(yytext, yyleng)
%}

%%

/* some pattern-matching regexs */

[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*  SAVE_TOKEN; return ID;

-?[0-9]*\.[0-9]*        SAVE_TOKEN; return DOUBLE;
-?[0-9]+                SAVE_TOKEN; return INTEGER;
0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+          SAVE_TOKEN; return INTEGER;

\"(\\.|[^\\"])*\"       SAVE_STRING; return STRING;
@\"(\\.|[^\\"])*\"      SAVE_STRING_NC; return STRING;
\'(\\.|.)\'             SAVE_STRING; return CHAR;

```


### The Generator of Common Nodes Tree

Abstract Class, which is the most usage of the functions to building the AST, can derive types of each kind of leaf nodes.  Those nodes may represent one kind of statements in our grammer, a simple expression, or just a number.

For the consideration about that our grammer should have extensibility, we won't arrange the statement node, and all kinds of the node types will be a basic constant or a data type.


We just defined some basic nodes for identity, types and constant fields:

* IDNode - which will contain an id-name
* TypeNode - type strings like "int[]"
* IntNode - just a integer
* StringNode - raw string
* FloatNode - a float point number

These nodes enable to arrange to a list liking the code in lisp.

Here is the nodes tree of a main function:

```lisp
(function main () (
    ...
    (return 0)
))
```

Some other useful statements will be listed below:

```lisp
(int x 10)  ; define varibals

(* (+ a b) (- 10 3)) ; expression

(for (int i 0) (< i 10) (++ i) ; for statement
    ...
)

(if (() ; if-else statement
    (< i j)
    (++ i))
    (return i))

```


The model layer can be generated by its constructive functions which is named by 'Create'. Here is an example of if-statement:

```bison

if_state : IF '(' expr ')' statement
          { $$ = Node::make_list(3, IDNode::Create("if"), $3, $5); }

         | IF '(' expr ')' statement ELSE statement
          { $$ = Node::make_list(4, IDNode::Create("if"), $3, $5, $7); }
         ;

```

The function `Node::make_list`, which is common in use, can create a list by passing a variable number of parameters.


Figure \ref{f4} shows the inheritance relationship between the models.

![\label{f4} Inheritance relationship diagram ](classNode.png)



### Traverse of The models

When the models have been created, the AST was confirmed. We can crawl the each node one by on or visit the node we need on its own.

`getChild()` and `getNext()` are used to traverse the AST, a left-child right-sibling binary tree.

Here is an example abour for-statement in C style:

```c
for (i = 0; i < j; ++i)
    return i;

```

in lisp style:  


```lisp
(for (           ; for-else statement
        (= i 0) ; init
        (< i j) ; condition
        (++ i)) ; action
    (return i)) ; body
```

The AST:
